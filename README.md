# GameEngine
This Java 3D game engine uses a mix of openGL and GLSL, LWJGL, and some custom classes to create a fully functional 3D game engine with different lighting systems, camera control, and the ability to load models.

Note: Please run Main.java in the src folder to currently get a small working demo of the engine.
