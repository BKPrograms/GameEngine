# GameEngine
This Java 3D game engine uses a mix of openGL and GLSL, LWJGL, and some custom classes to create a fully functional 3D game engine with different lighting systems, camera control, and the ability to load models.

Please download https://sourceforge.net/projects/java-game-lib/files/Official%20Releases/LWJGL%202.9.3/ and http://slick.ninjacave.com/slick-util/ (Slick-Util library only option), add them to the cloned project and run "Main".

Note: Please run Main.java in the src folder to currently get a small working demo of the engine.
